🚀 python_engine_brainbox

A structured Python refresher tailored for automation, testing, and ADAS simulation — ideal for automotive software engineers.

This repository complements my [`automotive_brainbox`](https://github.com/Op9745/automotive-brainbox) project, focusing purely on Python tooling, CLI applications, testing frameworks, and concurrent simulations — all within the automotive context.

🧭 Roadmap

| Day | Focus Area                     |
|-----|--------------------------------|
| 01  | Python Basics + Logic          |
| 02  | Object-Oriented Programming    |
| 03  | File Handling + CLI Tools      |
| 04  | PyTest + Mocking + BDD         |
| 05  | Threading + AsyncIO Simulation |
| 06  | Design Patterns + Clean Code   |
| 07  | Final Project + Interview Prep |

Each section includes hands-on projects, interview questions, and domain-specific challenges (e.g., CAN log parsers, sensor simulations, BDD scenarios for emergency braking).
